# \## 📊 Project Overview

# This project is based on the \*\*WideWorldsImporter dataset\*\*, a sample database provided by Microsoft that simulates an international wholesale company.  

# The dataset contains information about customers, suppliers, sales, purchases, stock levels, and employee details, which makes it ideal for practicing \*\*data analysis and optimization techniques\*\*.

# 

# The focus of this project is on \*\*Sales Analysis\*\*, using T-SQL, stored procedures, optimization strategies, and visualization with Power BI.

#

# 

# \## 🗂 Dataset Presentation

# The \*\*WideWorldsImporter\*\* dataset includes:

# \- Customers and suppliers  

# \- Sales orders and invoices  

# \- Stock and product information  

# \- Employees and purchasing details  

# 

# This rich dataset provides a realistic environment to explore \*\*business intelligence and reporting\*\*.

# 

# \## ⚙️ Stored Procedures

# A set of \*\*stored procedures\*\* were created to:

# \- Automate repetitive queries  

# \- Generate sales reports (e.g., monthly/yearly revenue, top products)  

# \- Simplify data retrieval for Power BI  

# \- Improve maintainability and modularity of the SQL code  

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🚀 SQL Optimization

# SQL queries were optimized by:

# \- Adding appropriate indexes  

# \- Reducing nested queries  

# \- Using joins effectively instead of subqueries  

# \- Applying query execution plan analysis  

# 

# Results of the optimization process:
